## Strava Interactive Data Reader

- General idea is to create a pseudo interactive online dashboard to essentially mimic a "spotify wrapped" but for a person's strava data
    - ie. Someone can download their data and share the export, then they will get a custom web-hosted page with stats and graphics that will be interactive

#### Folders:

- data -  holds a data export from strava
- exploration - notebooks and python files to understand the data
- scripts - compiled python files that process the data
- viz - html, css, js, d3 related items
