This app compares the performance of 2 Strava users given their activities sourced from the Stava API v3. 
Taking this information, the data is filtered and presented in 3 graphs specifying the cumulative distance for a given activity,
the count of the given activity, and the elevation gain for each of the users.
This allows for straightforward comparison of the two.
Please note that the graphs work best for the 3 main exercises: Run, Ride, Swim. Other activities that involve moving
distances work well, but stationary things like a strength workout don't.
